# CLI

you can run the cli in different ways:

- install with brew as a standalone binary or with (p)npm/yarn globally and run like a regular cli with `kowalski analysis`
- install with (p)npm/yarn locally and write a js/ts script with `!#/bin/node node` at the top or execute it with `node script.js` or `ts-node script.ts`
